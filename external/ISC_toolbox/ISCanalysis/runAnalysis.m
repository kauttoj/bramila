function runAnalysis(Params)

% This is the main function that performs ISC analysis for 
% preprocessed fMRI data. Analysis parameters (see initParams.m) 
% must be set by the user before running the analysis.
%
% Input fMRI data must be either in "nii" or "mat" -format 
% (see initParams.m). Output data is mapped into the memory and 
% can be quickly accessed through memory pointer objects.
%
% COMMAND LINE ANALYSIS:
% 
% After running the analysis, memory pointer objects can be loaded 
% to the Matlab's workspace by typing:
% load memMaps % objects are saved in analysis destination folder.
%
% GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE (GUI):
% 
% Specific GUI has been designed to visualize and analyze the results.
% After running the analysis, GUI can be launched by typing:
% load Tag % Tag is saved in the analysis destination folder
% ISCtool(Tag); % launch GUI from your GUI folder
% 
% Note: when you launch GUI make sure you have cleared all memory
% map pointer objects from Matlab workspace.
