This are just two simple templates on how to run parallel jobs on triton. There is large space for improvement.
To use it: 
	- copy the folder on your subfolder
	- use bramila_runtheblock.m as a template and make your own "block function": this function will be run in parallel
		by each instance/job
	- Open matlab from triton and simply run:

for blockID=1:10
    bramila_run_slurm_scripts(blockID,'/triton/becs/scratch/braindata/foldername/');
end

Then you can quit matlab and check the queue using

slurm q
